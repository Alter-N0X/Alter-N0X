I put the ‘dark’ in darknet and the ‘404’ in social life.

💀 Breaking things is a love language.

🖤 I read crash logs like poetry and speak in payloads whispered through the dark net.

⚰️ chmod 000 on emotions.

🧠 Obsession with flaws in systems, in code, in logic.

🔍 Seeking the obscure, the vulnerable, the misconfigured.

🌒 Eternal mood: the 2AM motivation 24/7.
